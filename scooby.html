			<p> Scooby Doo enjoys spending his free time hanging out with 
			Shaggy &amp; the gang but do you know what he likes to do most?
			If you guessed <strong>EATING</strong> then you probably have 
			watched as much Scooby do as I have!</p>
			<p>Scooby also enjoys spending his time solving mysteries with his gang.
			They have helped out many people in the past, and look forward to 
			helping many more.</p>
