			<p>Just like Scooby, Shaggy enjoys his <strong>Eating</strong>! When
			you have Shaggy and Scooby together, there is a <strong>great</strong> 
			possibility that your kitchen will be over run. These two have been know to
			demolish <strong>100 HOT DOGS IN ONE SITTING!</strong></p>
			<p>You will hardly ever see Shaggy without his best friend Scooby
			Doo at his hip. They always stick together and are never looking for 
			trouble, but somehow trouble always seem to find them first.</p>
