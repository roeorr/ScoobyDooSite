			<p>Fred is what most would consider the leader of the <em>Mystery Team</em>
			Fred always looks out for Shaggy and Scooby now matter what trouble the
			find themselves in. Fred usually drives the <em>Mystery Machine</em>
			whenever the gang is on their way to check out a haunted place. </p>
			<p>Fred also is said to have a crush on Daphne! Many of the episodes
			 on TV depict this lust he has for her but it is never truly 
			confirmed. </p>
